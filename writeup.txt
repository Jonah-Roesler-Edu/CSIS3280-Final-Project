[TEMPORARY WRITEUP]
This project is a database project for a "Over the Counter" pharmacy. Think something like in Safeway/London Drugs/Costco pharma
(it may possibly sell both normal medicine and ones requiring a prescription)

What it does is it keeps records on:
    clients
    doctors
    medicines
    prescriptions (if any)

In addition to this it will keep track of
    transactions
        Through transactions it will keep track of these for medical reasons:
            which clients puchased what medicine
            what doctors prescribed what medicine
    
IN GENERAL
a client will:
    -Browse the pharmacy for medicines (maybe sorted by type)
    -either Purchase online/puchase to pick up in store
    -submit prescription to pick up in store
